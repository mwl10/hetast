This repository inherits most of its code from https://github.com/reml-lab/hetvae, the official implementation of Heteroscedastic Temporal Variational Autoencoder for Irregularly Sampled Time Series (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11350.pdf). 

It's been modified to use for Time Domain Astronomy, more speficially for modeling AGN light curves in my MRes work at Durham University.
