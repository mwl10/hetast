    "This notebook downloads ZTF DR's light curves, using the ZTF API. \n",
    "For more details about ZTF service, go to their documentation: https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/ZTF/docs/releases/dr08/ztf_release_notes_dr08.pdf\n",
    "See section \"iii. Querying Lightcurves using the API\"\n",
    "\n",
    "More details can be found here: https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/program_interface/ztf_lightcurve_api.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Important notes:\n",
    "1) Lightcurves were constructed using exclusively measurements from the calibrated single-exposure PSF-fit- derived catalogs, not the aperture-based photometry catalogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The photometry catalogs, including lightcurve products, contain measurements of both point-like and extended objects. The PSF-fit photometry measurements are optimal for point-sources only. Concentric aperture photometry measurements are more optimal for extended objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) When downloading  light curves for a particular object, the ZTF API can return more than one light curve in a given filter. This happens because ZTF treats independently the light curves observed in a particular field, filter, and CCD-quadrant; thus, if a source appears in more than one combination of these three, ZTF will provide more than one light curve. The ZTF quadrants are calibrated independently, thus combining light curves from different fields and CCD-quadrants (but same filter), can produce spurious variability (van Roestel et al. 2021). Therefore, to avoid having multiple light curves for any particular source, we recommend to only use the longest light curve (in terms of its timespan or number of epochs) of each filter of a particular object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) If you don't specify the data release you want to use, th API will provide you the latest DR. "
